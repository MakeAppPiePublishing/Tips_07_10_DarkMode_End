        "Pizza Margherita - Street Food Nationalized:The legend goes that King Umberto and Queen Margherita of Italy got tired of The royal food, which was always French. Looking for both something new and something Italian, while in Naples they ordered a local pizzeria to make them pizza, which was up till then poor people's food.  The Queen loved a pizza of tomatoes, fresh mozzarella and basil so much the restaurant named the pizza after her. That the pizza was the colors of the Italian flag may not be a coinicidence. To this day to sell a true Neapolitan pizza, you must be certified by an association of pizza restaurants in Naples for the process and quality of ingredients.",
        "New York":"New York Pizza - Pizza Comes to America. The first known Pizza restaurant in the United States was in New York’s Little Italy. Gennaro Lombardi in 1905 opened his restaurant, but used a coal oven instead of a wood burning one, since coal was chaeper than wood in New York. New York Pizza breaks several traditions from its Italian ancestor. Most importantly it is sold in large slices, which meant whole pizzas were made larger than the traditional 14inch/35cm diameter. To make a larger pizza, a  higher gluten recipe is used for the crust, and the pizza is tossed in the air with a spinning motion.",
        "Chicago":"Chicago Deep Dish - No more flat crust for you!(buy a beer) In 1943, Ike Sewell changed the crust from the thin flatbread to a deep pan, adding traditional Italian/New York  ingredients. Sewell and his cook and eventual manager Rudy Malnati added a layer of sausage to the pan. Some believe the longer cooking time of 20 minutes to 45 minutes of the deep dish meant more beverage consumption, and a higher profit for the restaurant. Deep dish pizza caught on in Chicago, with many competitors in the area. With the 2 inch of deeper pizza crust, the order of ingredients can change between competitors, with a crust ranging in texture from cracker like to bread like and the cheese on top or on the sauce on top. Rudy's son Lou took the recipe north to the Chicago Surburb of Lincolnwood to start his own chain Other chicago restaurants starting copying the pan idea, making changes of thier own.",
        "California":"California Pizza - No longer Italian or street food. Wolfgang Puck Hired San Francisco chef Ed LaDou run his pizza oven at his exclusive restaurant when it opened in 1982, and use completely non-traditional ingredients, such as Duck sausage and smoked salmon. These pizzas still had a traditional crust. Whlie Queen Margherita may have made it permissible to eat poor peoples food, LaDou made it into rich people’s food - at first. Two Los Angles attorneys, Larry Flax and Rick Rosenfeld were so entranced by Ed LaDou’s pizzas they started a casual dining restaurant with some of LaDou’s creations, including a new one of barbecue sauce and chicken. The restaurant was so successful it became an chain throughout North America, South America and Asia, popularizing non-Italian and often Asian ingredients in pizza. A national food of Italy becomes a uniquely American food all over the world. Suspiciously, there are no locations in Europe."
